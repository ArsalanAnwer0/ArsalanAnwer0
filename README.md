**Hi there!**

I'm **Arsalan**, an aspiring DevOps Engineer and Cloud Engineer passionate about building and deploying scalable infrastructure.

I love working on complex cloud challenges through automation. When I'm not deploying cloud systems, you'll find me exploring new technologies and tools to optimize infrastructure.

All my projects are built from the ground up, from planning to deploying production ready solutions that solve real world problems.

I don't really have hobbies outside of tech, I'm not into sports, music, or socializing much. Building cloud solutions and automating infrastructure is only thing I am good at and also something I love doing.
