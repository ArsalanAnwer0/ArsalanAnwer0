## Cloud Engineer | Solutions Architect | Cloud Architecture

I'm an experienced cloud engineer building scalable and resilient infrastructure one deployment at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. Infrastructure as code is at the core of my approach, and I'm always looking to refine my implementations with efficient, scalable solutions.
